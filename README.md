My personal RL library (at the moment). Frequently changed and edited, but feel free to use as potential reference code (its mostly correct)



Implements PPO, DAPG w/ PPO, and GAIL (probably broken)

## Setup

I highly recommend using conda. Otherwise you can try and install all the packages yourself (at your own risk of not getting reproducible results)

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
